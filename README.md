# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
“End-to-end ML pipeline: Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and classification on Titanic dataset.”
Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning.

This project applies Logistic Regression to the Titanic dataset to classify whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

LIBRARIES USED:
1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)
3.Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
4.Scikit-learn (ML model)

WORKFLOW:
1.Cleaned dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables).
2.Explored survival patterns (gender, age, class).
3.Built and evaluated a Logistic Regression model.
4.Achieved 77% accuracy on test data.
